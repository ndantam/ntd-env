This directory contains various dotfiles used by Neil Dantam.  The
actual files live under ./ntd.  This is online mostly for my own
convenience, but other folks may find some of it interesting.

To install the files on a new machine, the ./install.sh script will
create hard links from ~ to the files here.  Symlinks would work for
some programs, but ssh won't take it.

Sometimes, the hard links break.  To keep the files in ~, run
backlink.sh.  To keep the files in ./ntd, run reinstall.sh.
