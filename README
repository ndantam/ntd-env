* README FOR NTD-DOTFILES *

This directory contains various dotfiles used by Neil Dantam.  The actual files
live under ./ntd.

To install the files on a new machine, the ./install.sh
script will create hard links from ~ to the files here.

To do a git update, you should first run the ./relink.sh script to fix links
that have somehow gotten screwed up.
