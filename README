* README FOR NTD-DOTFILES *

This directory contains various dotfiles used by Neil Dantam.  The actual files
live under ./ntd.

To install the files on a new machine, the ./install.sh
script will create hard links from ~ to the files here.

Sometimes, the hard links break.  To keep the files in ~, run backlink.sh.  To
keep the files in ./ntd, run reinstall.sh.
