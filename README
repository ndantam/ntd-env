This directory contains various dotfiles used by Neil Dantam.  The
actual files live under ./ntd.  This is online mostly for my own
convenience, but other folks may find some of it interesting.

To install the files on a new machine, the ./install.sh script will
create symlinks from ~ to the files here.
