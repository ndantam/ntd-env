This directory contains various dotfiles used by Neil Dantam.  The actual files
live under ./ntd.  This is online mostly for my own convenience, but it's other
folks may find some of this interesting.

To install the files on a new machine, the ./install.sh
script will create hard links from ~ to the files here.

Sometimes, the hard links break.  To keep the files in ~, run backlink.sh.  To
keep the files in ./ntd, run reinstall.sh.
