This directory contains various dotfiles used by Neil Dantam.  The
actual files live under ./ntd.  This is online mostly for my own
convenience, but other folks may find some of it interesting.

To install the files on a new machine, run `make' in the repo root to
create symlinks from $HOME to the files here.  WARNING: `make clean'
will DELETE the symlinks or copies of these files under $HOME.
